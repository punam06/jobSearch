## File Changes Made

### Models (`jobs/models.py`)
```python
# Added to Application model:
STATUS_CHOICES = [
    ('pending', 'Pending'),
    ('approved', 'Approved'),
    ('rejected', 'Rejected'),
]
status = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=STATUS_CHOICES, default='pending')
updated_at = models.DateTimeField(auto_now=True)

def get_status_color(self):
    # Returns appropriate CSS class for status
```

### Views (`jobs/views.py`)
```python
# Enhanced my_applications view with filtering
# Added update_application_status view for AJAX status updates
```

### URLs (`jobs/urls.py`)
```python
# Added new URL pattern:
path('applications/<int:application_id>/update-status/', views.update_application_status, name='update_application_status')
```

### Templates
- **`job_applications.html`**: Enhanced employer view with approve/reject buttons
- **`my_applications.html`**: Enhanced applicant view with status filtering

### Admin Interface (`jobs/admin.py`)
```python
# Enhanced ApplicationAdmin:
list_display = ('applicant', 'job_title', 'company_name', 'status', 'applied_at', 'updated_at')
list_filter = ('status', 'applied_at', 'updated_at', 'job__company_name')
list_editable = ('status',)
```
